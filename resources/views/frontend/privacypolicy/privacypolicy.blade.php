                provide them with certain processing services related to information owned or controlled by the
                restaurant. We seek assurances from restaurants and bars that they will process information in

                (including information used by its affiliates and service providers) for which it is an owner or

                    your reservation by sharing your information with the appropriate restaurant).</li>
                <li>Compliance with legal obligations to which we are subject (such as tax obligations, and when we are
                    obliged to comply with lawful requests from competent authorities such as law enforcement).</li>
                <li>To serve our legitimate interests (such as tailoring your experience with our Services, carrying out
                    online advertising, and for fraud detection), provided that such processing does not outweigh your
                    rights and freedoms. The processing may also be pursuant to other applicable legal bases for data
                    processing especially provisions set out under local law.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para-style">Where we use personal information to meet our legitimate interests, we take steps to

                take to ensure these rights are not infringed. You also have the right to object to such processing as

            <ul class="latest-style">
                <li>Consent. To the extent that a legal ground described above would not apply to processing of your

                through our Services, or if you are a guest of the person making the request, we necessarily provide
                certain categories of your information to the restaurant or bar to facilitate that request. For requests

                or may be accessible by that restaurant or bar, and they may respond to you. We will not tie your
                comments with other information that can identify you directly, but a restaurant may be able to tell who
                you are from your comments, particularly if you give your name in the comments or provide contact
